# Go Tour 

A flutter Android mobile application for tourism and giving ideas on where to go out to

## Getting Started

This project is for the tourists and anyone who doesn't have an idea of where to go next.
Based on your current location, Go Tour generates a full plan for the day 
by giving a few ideas on where to go next and what activities to do through giving
the users a lot of choices, all of them are as near as much as possible to each other.

This feature is done using Google Maps, Places and TravelAdvisor APIs connected together.
